# Description

This repository contains the R scripts used to read and analyse the climate data for Texas during the months of July 2022 and July 2021. These analysis was completed as coursework, and should be run in order of HW# file, as they built upon themselves. 

## Overview of the Scripts

*HW04* 
Was primarily geared towards creating, editing, and analyzing a simple baseball data.frame. 

*HW05* and *HW06* 
Focused on the climate data. Please note that the txt file the Data Files folder stores the original data containing all climate data produced by Texas in July 22 and July 21. Using that data, the HW scripts edit, manipulate, and analyze the difference in temperatures of the two years. We put particular focus on days beyond 100 degrees, of which there were significantly more in July 22. 

*HW06* 
This code focused on building basic graphics for the climate data, and in building a function to analyze financial data using an EMA approach. Using the BTC-USD.csv file as my data set, I created a function to create and display the EMA (Exponential Moving Average) of the financial dtat set. 

*Output files*
The output files contain the graphics each script created.
